# Number Frequency Analyzer
* A simple program that demonstrates how the number of iterations can influence the occurrence of numbers in a sequence

## How to use
* Provide two integers as input parameters: the range of numbers and the number of iterations
* For example, the following input analyzes the frequency of numbers in the sequence from 0 till 4 (including) over 100 iterations:
